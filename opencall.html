      <p>*Bibliomania 2018 organised by Tentacles and Waterproof Exhibitions, portable art initiative represented by Napisa Leelasuphapong and Rawiruj Suradin. Sharing passionate enthusiasm for collecting and possessing books, we would like to devote one wall of Tentacles’ space for collecting artist’s books, expecting to form an archive/library focusing on the contemporary artist’s books from Thailand, Asia and South East Asia (nevertheless we also collect artist’s books from the rest of the world) for the future researchers in this topic. You can download research newsletters on the topic about contemporary art and artist’s publications from Waterproof Exhibitions website, waterproofexhibitions.github.io</p>
