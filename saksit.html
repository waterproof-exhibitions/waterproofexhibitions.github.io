    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">SAKSIT KHUNKITTI</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Using a variety of mediums and materials from photography, moving-image to concrete, glass and metal. Saksit Khunkitti’s practice deals with the uncertainty of being and the desire for structure and stability by exploring diverse range dichotomies, such as those between idealism/pragmatism, modernism/post-modernism, conscious/unconscious and order/chaos. He attempts to find points of convergence between them, through observing the aesthetic, social, spatial and affective experiences of everyday life, especially within the context of built environments.<br>
      <br>
      For Saksit, the built environment represents human’s ability to overcome nature and createenvironments that are supposedly suitable for our needs and aspirations. They are the physical structures that surround us and shape our lives, sometimes they are manifestations of our collective dreams but more often than not, they are a mismatch collection of dreams, failures and compromises that reflect the state of our societies and their structures.<br>
