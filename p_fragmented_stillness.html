    <p>Whizzing through the cityâ€™s roads, while surrounded by other vehicles, we see glimpses of things that exist in the periphery, in the spaces in-between roads or under overpasses and expressways. These are public spaces that are born out of the leftover space from road building. They are spaces that stand in close proximity to the roads but operate at a different speed. They are in a way transient spaces much like the roads, but they can also be spaces for potentials and activities as well as somewhere to pause for a moment and be still.<br>
