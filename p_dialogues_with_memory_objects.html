    <h2 style="font-size: 22px;">DIALOGUES WITH MEMORY OBJECTS</h2>
    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">PAM VIRADA</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Virada became interested in the vast theme of ‘memory’ and how each and everyone of us contains the past in forms that are simultaneously subjective and objective. Communicated through one of the apparent forms of memory-collecting, she uses her spontaneous photographs juxtaposed in context to content excerpts from the 'The Book of Symbols', a book which is akin to a dictionary of the universal archetypal imageries within the modern world. The effect created engages the viewer to identify the dialogues between image and meaning, personal and universal, now and history. The personal memory Virada offers coincided with the universal archetypes excerpts may or may not portray the same meaning, the viewers as the third party will question the unapparent threshold that holds this photobook together.<br>
