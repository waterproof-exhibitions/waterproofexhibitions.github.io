    <br>
    <p>Canadian artist Rob Kovitz is the creator of Treyf Books, ingenious montage-appropriation "novels" that consist of texts and images compiled from various sources, usually obsessively related to one or more themes, and then recombined through a process of highly subjective editing, ordering and juxtaposition. In The Sweets of Home, which was originally commissioned by Dazibao Gallery in Montreal for the exhibition and publication titled Home Sweet Home: À propos de l’inquiétude, every text selection includes the words “home,” “sweet,” or “inquietude.” With special appropriated guest star David Byrne.<br>
      <br>
    Rob Kovitz’s previous super-cut bookworks include Pig City Model Farm, Room Behavior, Games Oligopolists Play, Death Wish Starring Charles Bronson Architect, Capital of the World, According to Plan, and the 8-volume award-winning appropriation epic, Ice Fishing in Gimli.<br>
