    <p>We have lived and worked on the ship Anuschka since years. Since 2014, we are traveling on European waterways, so far in France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and Germany. On the way, we examin numerous bridges. Using tentacles to scratch the bridges, the ship turns into a sensitive, perceiving and sounding laboratory interacting with the territory. Each of the bridges has its own personal profile. The sound is recorded, archived and permanently published in the mobile web-application "SoundWays". By the time, a bridge-sound cartographie is installed. Various aspects of theTentacles concept are constantly transformed and shown in galleries and contemporary art spaces as audiokinetic installations, live streams from the ship, radio broadcasts or multichannel sound installations.<br>
