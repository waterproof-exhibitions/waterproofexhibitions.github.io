    <p>I first exhibited my work in lomography exhibition in Chaingmai in 2007 at Minimal gallery in cooperation with Lomography Thailand. After quite a while I had a chance to co-exhibit my work with other artists at The Barn eatery design in Chiangmai under Galleries night Chiangmai project. After that, two of my photos were selected to be shown at “BYE BYE Chinatown” exhibition at Cho Why gallery. And in the same year I decided to put together all of my work and published my first collection-of-two photobooks which are Barracuda, color photobook, and Killer Whale, black and white photobook.<br>
