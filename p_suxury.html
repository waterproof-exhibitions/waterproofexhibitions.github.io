    <p>It is trying to approach to the critical and humorous ways about consumption culture of capitalism.  And basically this is mocking of luxury magazine to promote luxury goods. Mainly It is including the conceptual bags made by plastics mimicking luxury bags and the playful installations made by plastic trashes to show an exhibition. Usually plastics are one usage and regarded useless but here they are all very important materials challenging to the dignity of art. Sarcastic humor and critic are adding with my performance.<br>
