    <p>Have you ever forgotten the importance of the people close to you? The importance of all the household objects you are “familiar” with may be forgotten as time goes by. To arrange flowers with these objects is to express relations between the objects and the flowers as well as to breathe life into those forgotten items again. Sometimes, being used to certain things means forgetting their importance or even worse, the importance of ourselves.<br>
    <br>
    This book’s arrangement aims to present the gap between the past and the present identity of ourselves. Though these identities belong to one and the same person, it highlights how the transition from childhood to adulthood may detract from the importance of being our true selves. As each page is turned, the flower picture of our present gradually unfolds to the page showing the picture of our juvenile self. Finally, when the book is completely unfolded, the two pictures are but a page apart.<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, we take the ones close to us for granted, especially ourselves. This art display will be featured on the book and is a space that allows self-identity from both periods to finally meet, even if only when the book is closed.<br>
